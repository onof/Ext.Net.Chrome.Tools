# ExtNetEventSniffer
Ext.Net Message Bus Sniffer shows the events published on the Ext.Net Message Bus in the current page.
This extension is useful for ASP.NET developers working with Ext.Net.

If you need a simple way to get the latest event published on the Ext.Net message bus this extension is for you. It shows the event (name, date and data sent along with the message in JSON format).

The extension sniffs the Ext.Net message bus. If any event occurs in the page, an icon showing a bus appears in the address bar. Click it to see the events occurred on the page.
